## 🎯 Slide-by-Slide Guide

### Slide 1-2: Opening (5 minutes)
**Key Message:** "700 words created 116 pages in 60 minutes"

**Delivery Tips:**
- Start with the shocking statistics
- Build suspense - don't explain HOW yet
- Ask: "How is this possible?" before advancing

**Common Questions:**
- "Is this real?" → Show them howitsmade.md
- "Does this always work?" → Manage expectations, works for structured tasks

---

### Slide 3-4: The Conversation (5 minutes)
**Key Message:** "Simple, clear, contextual communication"

**Delivery Tips:**
- Read the actual messages out loud
- Emphasize the brevity
- Point out the key elements: intent, scope, constraints

**Demo Opportunity:**
- Have howitsmade.md open
- Scroll through showing the actual conversation
- Let them see it's not magic - it's method

**Talking Points:**
- "Notice what the user DIDN'T do - no templates, no micromanaging"
- "Only 100 words, but they're the RIGHT 100 words"

---

### Slide 5-6: What Made This Effective (10 minutes)
**Key Message:** "Context + Constraints + Trust = Results"

**Delivery Tips:**
- Use the split: what user provided vs what AI contributed
- Emphasize collaboration, not dictation
- This is the core teaching moment

**Interactive Element:**
Ask participants:
- "What would YOU have added to these prompts?"
- Most will say things that weren't needed
- Discussion point: less is more with context

**Watch For:**
- Participants who want to over-specify
- Address: "Trust the AI to apply expertise"

---

### Slide 7-11: Core Principles (10 minutes)
**Key Message:** "Change how you think about working with AI"

**Delivery Tips:**
- Give examples for each principle
- Use the ❌/✅ format - clear contrast
- Encourage note-taking here

**Principle 1: Context over Commands**
- Bad: "Create a prompt"
- Good: "Create a prompt for project managers to scope new IT initiatives for senior stakeholders"

**Principle 2: Constraints over Details**
- Constraints guide, details restrict
- "Assume MS 365 access" vs "Query this specific API endpoint..."

**Principle 3: Trust**
- Hardest for many people
- Address: "You can always refine"

**Principle 4: Iterate**
- Show conversation flow from repo
- Natural progression

---

### Slide 12-14: Live Demo (10 minutes)
**Key Message:** "See it in action"

**Demo Option 1: Show an Existing Prompt**
1. Open [prompts/daily-activity.md](prompts/daily-activity.md)
2. Walk through structure:
   - Purpose
   - Context
   - Instructions
   - Output format
   - Examples
3. Point out: "This was generated, not hand-written"

**Demo Option 2: Live Generation (Advanced)**
If you're comfortable:
1. Open Claude.ai or Claude Code
2. Create a simple prompt based on audience suggestion
3. Show the interaction in real-time

**Safety Net:**
If live demo fails, fall back to showing the files

**Talking Points:**
- "Notice the detail level"
- "See how examples are included"
- "This would take hours to write manually"

---

### Slide 15-17: Productivity Analysis (Quick hit)
**Key Message:** "The numbers don't lie"

**Delivery Tips:**
- Let the table speak for itself
- Emphasize 168-252x multiplier
- But also: "It's not just speed, it's quality"

**Reality Check:**
- Not every task sees this multiplier
- Structured, documented tasks benefit most
- Novel/creative work still needs human touch

---

### Slide 18-20: Real-World Applications (5 minutes)
**Key Message:** "You can do this for your work"

**Delivery Tips:**
- Ask: "What do YOU document/create regularly?"
- Connect to their daily tasks
- Make it relevant to the room

**Suggested Questions:**
- "Who writes weekly status reports?"
- "Who does code reviews?"
- "Who creates project documentation?"
- For each yes: "This approach works for that"

---

### Slide 21: The Meta Moment (2 minutes)
**Key Message:** "Even the documentation of this process used this process"

**Delivery Tips:**
- Light moment, have fun with it
- 27 words → 900 words
- Reinforces the principle recursively

---

### Slide 22-23: **HANDS-ON EXERCISE** (15 minutes)
**Key Message:** "Now it's your turn"

**Exercise Structure:**

**1. Setup (2 minutes)**
- Show the template
- Explain the task
- Set 10-minute timer

**2. Individual Work (10 minutes)**

---

### Slide 24-27: Key Takeaways (5 minutes)
**Key Message:** "Here's what to remember"

**Delivery Tips:**

**Delivery Tips:**
- Match to their environment
- Don't get too technical unless audience wants it
- Focus on easiest entry point

**Recommendation:**
- Start with Claude.ai (lowest barrier)
- Then explore CLI
- Then API integration

**For MS 365 Integration:**
- Acknowledge it requires setup
- Point to resources
- Optional for learning

---

### Slide 42-43: Best Practices (3 minutes)

**Delivery Tips:**
- Make it concrete
- Make it achievable
- Offer support

**The Ask:**
- This week: Use one prompt
- This month: Create 5 custom prompts
- This quarter: Share with team

**Follow-Up:**
- Optional: Schedule a follow-up session

- Build a community of practice

---

### Slide 45-47: Q&A (5-10 minutes)
**Key Message:** "Let's discuss"

**Common Questions & Answers:**

**Q: "Will this replace my job?"**
A: No, it augments your work. You still provide judgment, strategy, creativity. AI handles repetitive structure.

**Q: "What if it gives wrong information?"**
A: Always review outputs. AI is a draft generator, you're the editor.

**Q: "How do I know if my prompt is good?"**
A: Test it! If 80% of outputs are useful, it's good.

**Q: "Can I use this for [specific task]?"**
A: If it's structured and repeatable, probably yes. Try it!

**Q: "What about data privacy?"**
A: Use your organization's approved AI tools. Don't put sensitive data in prompts.

**Q: "How much does this cost?"**
A: Depends on tool. Claude.ai has free tier. API has usage costs. Usually worth the time savings.
