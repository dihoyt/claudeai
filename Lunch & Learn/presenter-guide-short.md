**Q: "What if it gives wrong information?"**
A: Always review outputs. You're the editor, AI is the draft generator.

**Q: "How do I know if my prompt is good?"**
A: Test it! If 80% of outputs are useful, it's good.

**Q: "What about data privacy?"**
A: Use your organization's approved tools. Don't put sensitive data in prompts.

**Q: "Can I use this for [specific task]?"**
A: If it's structured and repeatable, probably yes. Try it!
